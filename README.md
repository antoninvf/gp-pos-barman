POS system for a restaurant, is a point of sale system in the form of a web application made with the ASP.Net and Next.js frameworks, where a waiter or a barman puts in what the customer ordered. Inputted food then gets sent into the kitchen in the app, where the chef sees what he needs to make, together with notes as what to omit or what rarity to make a steak.
